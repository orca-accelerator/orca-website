# Requesting Access to Orca

Access to Orca is free, and available to all students, educators, and researchers in the Oregon region.
Just follow the steps listed below.

## Step 1. Create an Account

Fill out the [account creation form](https://orca.pdx.edu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:13).
You will be prompted to log in using your institutional login.

> [!INFO] Choosing a Username
>
> When choosing a username, we recommend the format `user_institution` (where your email is typically `user@institution.edu`).

> [!Question] If your institution is not listed
>
> Your institution may not listed as an available option in the login page; this is likely because they are not part of the [InCommon Federation](https://incommon.org).
> In this case, we recommend that you first create an [ACCESS CI](https://access-ci.org) account.
> After creating your ACCESS account, select ACCESS CI as your institution when logging into the Orca account creation webpage.

## Step 2. Account Approval

After creating the account, it will be submitted to Orca administrators for approval.
Once administrators approve the account creation you will be notified by email.

## Step 3. Upload SSH Public Key

Access to the Orca cluster requires SSH authentication.
Once the account is created, [upload your SSH public key](https://orca.pdx.edu/registry) using the web interface.
For information on creating SSH key pairs and using SSH authentication, [see the documentation]({{< ref "connecting/#authentication-with-ssh-keys" >}}).
