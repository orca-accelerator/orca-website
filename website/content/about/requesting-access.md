# Requesting Access

Orca is currently in a pre-launch early-access phase.
Cluster access is currently limited to beta testers.
To inquire about access, please email orca@pdx.edu listing:

* Name and position
* Institution
* Other relevant context for the request

After the full launch of the Orca cluster (summer 2025), access will be granted upon request to students, researchers, and faculty from institutions in the region.
