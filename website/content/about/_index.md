# About the Orca Project and Cluster

The Orca (Oregon Regional Computing Accelerator) project provides free-of-charge access to high-performance GPU-accelerated computing resources.
Orca is [funded by the National Science Foundation]({{< ref "acknowledgements.md" >}}) and hosted at Portland State University.

## Getting Started

For information on **getting access to Orca**, **connecting to the Orca cluster**, and **using Orca to accelerate your research**, see the [getting started tutorial]({{< ref "docs/tutorial.md" >}}).

## Getting Help

For help using the Orca cluster, see the [documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}).
You can join the [Google Group]({{< ref "getting-help.md" >}}) or [Zulip Chat]({{< ref "getting-help.md" >}}) to ask questions and participate in community discussions (see the [getting help page]({{< ref "getting-help.md" >}}) for more information).

## Compute Resources

Orca's current configuration includes 100 GPUs across 25 high-performance compute nodes.
Detailed specs can be found on the {{< autolink "compute-resources.md" >}} page.
